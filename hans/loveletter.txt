From the moment I saw you, my heart knew it had found its GPS signal. Without you, I’d be as lost as a sock in the dryer. You’re the peanut butter to my jelly, the mac to my cheese, the Wi-Fi to my router—without you, I'm just buffering!
Every day with you is like opening my inbox to find a spam-free, 100% genuine email, which is to say, you're rare and precious. I could go on about how stunningly beautiful you are (because, let's be real, you outshine the stars), but it’s more than that. You’re my best friend, my confidante, my late-night ice cream buddy, and let’s face it, my biggest distraction. They say love is blind, but if that’s true, I’m ready to walk into walls for you every day.
Whenever we're apart, it’s like my heart goes into airplane mode, just waiting to connect again. You make my heart skip beats like it's on a low battery, and I’m forever charging it by being near you. I’d walk a thousand miles just to hold your hand (and let’s be honest, I’d probably complain about the walk halfway through), but I’d do it just for you.
And, my love, here’s something to always keep in mind: if kisses were snowflakes, I’d send you a blizzard. But don’t worry, I’m not saying you need to freeze—I’d be right there to warm you up!
Alicia, I promise to keep loving you with all the cheesiness in my heart. You’re my everything, the reason my world spins, and the little bit of sunshine that brightens my every day. Let’s make forever a thing, okay?
